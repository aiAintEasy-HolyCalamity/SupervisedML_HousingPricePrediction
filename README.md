Overview
Goal: Train a model to predict home prices based on historical data.​
Dataset: California Housing Prices (from sklearn).​
ML Algorithm: Linear Regression (Supervised Learning).​
Output: Predicted price based on input features.​

Install dependencies
Load the dataset using Python and real-world housing price data
  Features include median income, population, rooms per household, etc..​
  Target: Predict Price column.

Preprocessing Data
Train a Supervised ML Model (Linear Regression)
  The model learns a mathematical relationship between features and house prices.​
  Predicts home prices based on input data.​

Evaluate the Model
  Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average prediction error.​
  Mean Squared Error (MSE): Penalizes larger errors more.​
  Lower values = Better predictions.

Visualize Predictions
  A perfect model would have points along the diagonal line (y = x).​
  Helps visualize model accuracy.

Better Visualization
  Key Observations:​
    Ideal Model vs. Reality:​
      A perfect prediction model would have all points lying exactly on the diagonal line (y = x).​
      If your scatter plot shows points closely aligned with this diagonal, it indicates a good prediction accuracy.​
      If points are widely scattered away from the diagonal, the model may have high error rates.​
  Prediction Spread & Bias:​
    Overestimation: If most points are above the diagonal, the model is over-predicting home prices.​
    Underestimation: If most points are below the diagonal, the model is under-predicting.​
    Balanced Distribution: If the points are evenly distributed around the diagonal, the model has less bias.​
  Variance & Model Fit:​
    If points are tightly clustered around the diagonal, the model is well-fitted.​
    If points are widely spread out, the model may need improvements (e.g., adding more features, using a non-linear model).​
  Possible Issues & Next Steps:​
    Heteroscedasticity (Uneven Spread of Errors): If errors increase as home prices increase, you might need a more complex model (e.g., Random Forest Regression).​
    Feature Engineering Needed: If the model is performing poorly, it may be missing key factors affecting home prices (e.g., location data, housing demand trends).​

Expected Results​
  Lower MAE & MSE compared to Linear Regression, indicating better accuracy.​
  Scatter plot should show points closer to the x = y diagonal, meaning better predictions.

Key Observations​
  Higher Median Income (MedInc) Correlates with Higher Prices​
  Home 1 (MedInc = 8.5) has the highest predicted price (4.16).​
  Home 2 (MedInc = 5.2) has the lowest predicted price (3.27).​
  This follows the expected trend: higher-income neighborhoods tend to have more expensive homes.​
  
Effect of House Age on Prices​
  Home 3 is the oldest house (45 years) but still has a relatively high price (4.09).​
  This suggests that age alone doesn’t dictate home prices—other factors like location and median income have a stronger influence.​
  
Location Matters (Latitude & Longitude Influence)​
  Home 1 and Home 3 are in similar locations (Southern California) and have higher prices (~4.1).​
  Home 2, which is farther north (-121 longitude), has the lowest price (~3.27).​
  This suggests that location is a key predictor, aligning with real-world trends where housing demand varies by region.​

Impact of Population & Occupancy​
  Home 3 has the highest population density (1200 people) and highest occupancy (4 people per unit).​
  Despite this, its predicted price is slightly lower than Home 1, indicating that population alone doesn’t drive price—income, location, and home features are bigger factors.​

Model Performance & Next Steps​
  ✅ XGBoost effectively captures complex relationships (non-linear dependencies).​
  ✅ Further analysis could include feature importance (to see which variables impact price the most).​
  ✅ Comparing these predictions with actual market prices could validate the model’s accuracy.​
NOTE: A predicted price of 4.16 means the model estimates the home’s price to be $416,000.​
A population of 980 means the number of people living in a given housing block. Lower numbers mean more rural.​
